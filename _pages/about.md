## About me
Hello, distinguished visitors! I'm Zhijie Liu, a lifelong learner who transitioned from playful “doctor” dreams in childhood to exploring the compelling symphony of optoelectronic information science and engineering.

Despite swapping the pretend stethoscope for a real-world adventure with photons and algorithms, the initial dream didn’t dissolve—it simply took on a new, gleaming form. Now, with modesty and perpetual curiosity, I seek to weave into my journey a PhD focusing on biomedical imaging and deep learning optimization. My hope is to discreetly bolster the medical field with nuanced, innovative technological support.

Embarking on this endeavor, I aim to bring forth a future where my zeal for technology supports and enhances the medical field in its noble pursuits. If you’re navigating this digital corridor, perhaps we might journey together in unison toward this fascinating confluence of biomedicine and engineering.

## Education
_B.E._ in Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering in [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/)  
_June 2020 - September 2024_ (expected graduation time)

## Research Interests
My previous research interests have been largely centered around metasurface design and optimization algorithms, as well as the application of deep learning algorithms in biomedical imaging.

## Participation
- **RA in MOST**: From 2020 to 2023, I was honored to work as a research assistant in the Microoptical Section Tomography (MOST) team supervised by [Prof. Jing Yuan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nfzawnwAAAAJ&hl=en) at the [Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics](https://wnlo.hust.edu.cn). At first, I participated in the semi-automatic tracking of rat brain neuron test data. And then I was responsible for mouse glomerular image segmentation processing in the project of Fast and high-precision segmentation of all glomeruli in whole-kidney microscopic optical images via FastCellpose. Now we have a paper in delivery. I am currently in charge of a project on unpaired adversarial learning to improve optical tomography.
- **RA in NanoLab**: Between 2022 and 2023, I was honored to take on the role of research assistant at the [Nanophotonics Laboratory](http://nanophotonics.oei.hust.edu.cn/) supervised by [Prof. Zhenyu Yang](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/yangzhenyu1/zh_CN/index.htm), where my work focused on the design of metalens arrays for rotary zoom and light detection.
