## About me
Hello, distinguished visitors! I'm Zhijie Liu, a lifelong learner who transitioned from playful “doctor” dreams in childhood to exploring the compelling symphony of optoelectronic information science and engineering.

Despite swapping the pretend stethoscope for a real-world adventure with photons and algorithms, the initial dream didn’t dissolve—it simply took on a new, gleaming form. Now, with modesty and perpetual curiosity, I seek to weave into my journey a PhD focusing on biomedical imaging and deep learning optimization. My hope is to discreetly bolster the medical field with nuanced, innovative technological support.

Embarking on this endeavor, I aim to bring forth a future where my zeal for technology supports and enhances the medical field in its noble pursuits. If you’re navigating through this digital corridor, perhaps we might journey forward together in unison towards this fascinating confluence of biomedicine and engineering?
